This error occurs when you try to access an object that has been deallocated. This commonly happens when you have a strong reference cycle in your application, leading to memory leaks and unexpected crashes.  For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) AnotherClass *anotherObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
// ...
@end

@interface AnotherClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) MyClass *myObject;
@end

@implementation AnotherClass
// ...
@end

//In some part of your app:
MyClass *myInstance = [[MyClass alloc] init];
AnotherClass *anotherInstance = [[AnotherClass alloc] init];

myInstance.anotherObject = anotherInstance;
anotherInstance.myObject = myInstance; //Strong reference cycle!

//Later, if both instances are no longer needed, they won't be deallocated.
//Accessing members of either after they're released results in a crash.
```

This might manifest as a completely unexpected crash, without clear error messages, especially if the deallocated object is accessed much later than its release,  possibly during a background task or in response to an event.
